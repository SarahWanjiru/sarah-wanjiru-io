To deploy your website on GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1. Create a GitHub Repository
Sign in to GitHub: If you don’t have a GitHub account, create one at GitHub.

Create a New Repository:

Go to your GitHub profile and click on the "Repositories" tab.
Click the "New" button to create a new repository.
Enter a repository name (e.g., my website), provide a description (optional), and choose the visibility (public or private).
Click "Create repository."
2. Add Your Website Files to the Repository
Clone the Repository:

Open your terminal or Git Bash.
Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-website.git
Replace your-username with your GitHub username and my-website with your repository name.
Add Your Website Files:

Copy your website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) into the cloned repository directory on your local machine.
Commit and Push Changes:

Navigate to the repository directory:
bash
Copy code
cd my-website
Add the files to the staging area:
bash
Copy code
git add .
Commit the changes with a message:
bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Add initial website files"
Push the changes to GitHub:
bash
Copy code
git push origin main
Make sure to replace main with the default branch name if it’s different.
3. Configure GitHub Pages
Go to Your Repository Settings:

On GitHub, navigate to your repository’s main page.
Click on the "Settings" tab.
Scroll to the GitHub Pages Section:

Under the "Pages" section in the settings, find the "Source" drop-down menu.
Select the Branch:

Choose the branch you want to deploy from (usually main or master).
Optionally, select the folder from which to deploy (usually /root for the main directory).
Save Changes:

Click "Save" to update the settings.
4. Access Your Deployed Website
Find the URL:

After a few minutes, your website will be available at https://your-username.github.io/my-website/.
Replace your-username with your GitHub username and my-website with your repository name.
Visit Your Website:

Open the URL in your web browser to view your live website.
Troubleshooting
Empty Repository Warning: Ensure your repository is not empty. GitHub Pages needs at least an index.html file.
Cache Issues: If changes don’t appear immediately, try clearing your browser cache or use a private/incognito window.
That’s it! Your website should now be live on GitHub Pages.
